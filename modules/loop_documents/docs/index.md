## Marking text for proofreading

Marking text for proofreading is done in two different ways depending
on whether a block of text or individual words is marked.

### Marking a block of text

Place the cursor in the block of text (e.g. a paragraph, a table
cell), but *do not select any text*. Click on ![the proofread
icon](../ckeditor/plugins/proofread/icons/proofread.png) to mark the
text for proofreading.

### Marking individial words

Select the words to be marked and click on ![the proofread
icon](../ckeditor/plugins/proofread/icons/proofread.png) to mark the
text for proofreading. When selecting words, be careful to select
whole words.

### Unmarking text

To unmark text for proofreading, i.e. remove the marking, place the
cursor in the marked text (do not select anything) and click on ![the
proofread icon](../ckeditor/plugins/proofread/icons/proofread.png).
